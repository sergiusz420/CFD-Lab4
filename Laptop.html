<p>

	notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small,<br />portable
	personal computer (PC).
</p>
<p>

	inside of the upper<br />
	lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the
	lower lid.
</p>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<p>
	Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have changed
	significantly,<br />resulting in a variety of visually and technologically
	differing subclasses.
</p>
<p>
	Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably Ultrabook), hard
	distinctions between<br />
	these classes were rare, and their usage has varied over time and between
	sources.
</p>
<p>
	Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly used, with
	sizes distinguished<br />largely by the size of the screen.

<p>
	The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop
	counterparts.
</p>
<p>
	Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design
	restrictions on power,<br />size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum
	performance of laptop parts compared to that of<br />
	desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.
